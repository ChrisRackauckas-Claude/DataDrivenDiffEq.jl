# DataDrivenSR

DataDrivenSR provides an API to [`SymbolicRegression.jl`](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl) to infer arbitrary systems of equations.

```math
y_{i} = f(x_{i}, p, t_i, u_{i})
```

For examples see the tutorial section.

!!! warning "DataDrivenSR temporarily disabled"
    DataDrivenSR is currently disabled due to SymbolicRegression v1 being incompatible with SymbolicUtils v4. See [issue #590](https://github.com/SciML/DataDrivenDiffEq.jl/issues/590) for details.
